## Project structure
For more information about the project structure, check the [`{structured}`](https://giuseppett.github.io/structured/) package.

## TODO
- Maybe add some exploratory data analysis. Just for the fun.
- Add `parsnip::boost_tree` model to `workflows`.
- Use `{tidyposterior}` to compare models.
- Use `{DALEX}` to interpret final model.
